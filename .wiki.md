# Project Summary
The project is a cloud-based inventory management system designed to enhance operational efficiency for businesses. It allows users to manage inventory, suppliers, invoices, and shipments seamlessly, with features like real-time data synchronization and advanced analytics. Recent updates have improved invoice management and introduced profit margin calculations for items, along with support for a base currency in pricing.

- **Items Management**: Add, edit, and remove item records; includes fields for cost price, profit margin, and profit amount.
- **Suppliers Management**: Manage supplier details, including contacts and payment terms.
- **Invoices Management**: Generate and track invoices with automatic numbering and optional due dates.
- **Locations Management**: Monitor storage locations and capacities.
- **Shipping Management**: Oversee shipment details, including tracking statuses and costs, with real-time updates.
- **Currencies Management**: Manage multiple currencies with CRUD operations and real-time updates.
- **Reports**: Generate reports on inventory and supplier performance.
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate reflection of changes across all pages.
